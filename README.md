## Overview

### Running this project on your machine

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### **Learn More**

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS modules
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Redux

### What I learned

It was an awesome project. I could practice all the fundamentals of React as well as Redux. Initially, I used the Context API to menage the global app data. However, it became unproductive when the possibility to make a reply of a comment reply was added. So it was a great project to practice the main React features

### Continued development

Now that I feel confident with React, I plan to learn React Router and Framer Motion so that I can make beautiful, animated SPAs.
